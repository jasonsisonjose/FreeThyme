With such a fast-paced society, it is extremely hard to have schedules match up, finding a time that works for everyone is tough. With FreeThyme, you will be able to compare google calendars to easily find a time!

Our project involves using the google calendar API to generate a time and date when a given number of calendars have an opening. Python and Flask would be used to create the backend while Bootstrap would be used for the frontend. The goal of our application is to simplify the task of scheduling events for everyone involved.
